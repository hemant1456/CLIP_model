# Simple Implementation of OpenAI CLIP Model

## Overview
This repository contains a streamlined Jupyter notebook (`clip.ipynb`) demonstrating a simple implementation of the OpenAI CLIP model. The original code, adapted from a tutorial on Towards Data Science, has been significantly simplified for clarity and ease of understanding, making it particularly accessible for beginners.

## Key Changes
- **Code Simplification**: Removed unnecessary complexities and performance-only enhancements.
- **Enhanced Clarity**: Rewritten with an emphasis on readability and straightforwardness.
- **Single Notebook**: All relevant code is now contained within one well-organized Jupyter notebook.

## Installation
